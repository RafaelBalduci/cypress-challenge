## Challenge 1 - Writing Your First Automated Test!
### Phase 1

Imagine that you are working in a team that is developing a new application for a school. Your task this sprint is to develop an E2E test to verify that it is possible to register a new student.
The steps you must follow are:

1. Visit the website
2. Fill all the fields with valid data
3. Click on the submit button
‌
For this first part, you don’t need to check if the student was registered successfully.

### Phase 2

Now we are going to make sure the new student was registered correctly.

You must edit the same test from before. Now you are going to add the final steps to the test.
Assert all student information is displayed correctly below the form.
